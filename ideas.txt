Â· finish first refactor
- create style signleton
- test refactor
- debug
- second refactor (add features in notes)
- refactor todo list



Our Visualization Library:
- Next
    -- First Refactor: Just Naming (and small improvements)
    -- seperate styling and defaults into seperate file called "style.py"
    -- so really, style is a render object? it renders the whole layout
    -- all style calculations and modifcations now done in object
    -- factor out make iterable
    -- test changes of size
    -- check for unused imports
    -- better pass style a coordinate rather than a state machine
    -- passing kwargs poorly
    -- test with different # of axis on track
    -- Don't allow more than 4 axis!
    -- axis on both sides
    -- what to do when any of these render functions are called independetly
  # need to interpret how we are referring to the axis/track (by name, by position, by object, it should be automatic)
  -- get axis/get track should have one function
  -- should axis/tracks point at their parents? I think so, and we should have a delete operator
  -- gotta deal with all of the ways we delete it
  -- make sure axis can't be added twice
  -- what happens if you delete the underlying data?
  -- can we make that shit immutable (unless you delete... the axis?... or the trace?...)
  -- recalibrate y axis (should this happen during rendering)
  # function to flip axis
  # function to reorder axes
  # Calling process data outside of stuff
  # A separate style object
  # Use examples
  # tracks have optional names, titles?
  - Deal with deleting objects and notifying parent objects
  - Combine Axes into one xaxis
  - Design Review with Design Helper Functions
  - Combine Two Figures (Overlow, Concatenate)
  - Test with title
  - Basic Styling Functions
  - More documentation?
  - Add ndarray
  - Add xarray
  - Add pandas
  - Add welly well
  - Add welly project
  - Steven's Tops
  - Other categorical data
  - Functions for accessing dictionary
  - Categories
  - need to catch layout change and set ticks (auto nticks doesn't work, no tickmode kinda works, wish i knew what it fucking was)
  - impossible to get yaxis lines if all yaxis anchored to the same thing
  - Concatenate should be default figure behavior, but there could be a match mnemonic directive
- Structural Issues
 - How do we deal with y axis that are different/missing etc
 - set Y limits and don't use autorange=reversed
- Datahealth Visualization (different than tracks)
- Documentation, Docstrings, Tags
- Basic Displayers
    - We need to steal clicks and write clicks
    - You can also add lines
    - You can also shade depths
    - Be able to save visualizations (obviously)
    - But apply that saved visualization to other data? And to include adding and removing curves
    - Margin's on axis
- Change depth/hide/remove/etc visualizations easily
- Calculate Chatter
- Convert to widget and include a pause rendering


Data Structure Enhancements:
- Adding notes on depths
- Adding on depts on curves
- Adding ranges
- Alternative fileformat, LivingLasFiles (versions)
- Curves could be "add to las file" or not
- Welly Based?
- Quality checks

Database Enhancements:
- Browse Mnemonics, Their Relationships, and Recipts for them, Tools, Tolerances, and Ranges

Jupyter Enhancements:
- Las files in their own tab (some kind of versioning/original system)
- Explore las files, menumonics, adn their meanings
- All the just typical juptyer enhancements

Plotly Enhancements:
- Better hover 
- Polygons
- Separate Legends
- Add markers
- mode bar needs to be mine
- mode bar open/close
- more options

read plotly, all of it, yjs, js, python, juperlab, dash, dash-lab
your living las object will be the structure
